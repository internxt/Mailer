Templates
---------

To add a new email template to this package, see the `templates/` directory.
Choose a new name for the template and create 3 files:

* `templatename.subject` - Contains plain text subject text (hbs supported)
* `templatename.txt` - Contains plain text email body (hbs supported)
* `templatename.html` - Contains HTML formatted email body (hbs supported)

Once these files are added to the templates directory, you can reference them 
by `templatename` when calling `Mailer#dispatch`.
